## Discussion

### Process

We started development of our system with a backend API with a combination of TDD with JUNIT as our supporting test tool. We first converted the assignment instructions into a list of user-stories, which could more easily be interpreted and developed into code. We then converted these user-stories into BDD Cucumber scenarios, which generated our feature step-definitions which could then be filled with JUNIT code. 

### Language

We used Java Maven for our backend API supported by Cucumber and JUNIT for testing.
For our frontend we used Javascript with a REACTJS framework supported by Selenium for our tests. 

### Database

Database was done in MYSQL using Hibernate
