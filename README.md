## Discussion

### Process

We started development of our system with a backend API with a combination of TDD with JUNIT as our supporting test tool. We first converted the assignment instructions into a list of user-stories, which could more easily be interpreted and developed into code. We then converted these user-stories into BDD Cucumber scenarios, which generated our feature step-definitions which could then be filled with JUNIT code. 

### Language

We used Java Maven for our backend API supported by Cucumber and JUNIT for testing.
For our frontend we used Javascript with a REACTJS framework supported by Jest/React-Testing-Library/Cypress for our tests. 

### Database

Database was done in MYSQL using Hibernate

#### Some notes

* Location table is synonymous with address
* Schedule is a period of time
* There are multiple 'User' types: Student, Teacher etc.
* A course is a lesson, and a subject is the topic. (FX. Subject: Computer-science -> 
Course: classSem1B)
* Schedule is what a lot of relationships in the database are built around.
A schedule will have a relationship with a room(room has many schedules) and a schedule will have a course.
